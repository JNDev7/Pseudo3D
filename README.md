# Pseudo3D
A 2D game engine with a Z axis and a fake depth effect

This game engine can listen for keyboard input to control game objects. Game objects can move about in 3D space with simple physics with position, velocity, and acceleration. These objects also have 3D collisions. The rendering is all 2D, as all objects are represented by sprites. By scaling the images based on view angle and distance from the camera, a fake 3D depth effect is created. The camera points in the negative Z direction always and can be repositioned in the scene as needed.

This is my first non-minecraft project, so this is mainly me experimenting with Java in ways I have not done so before.
